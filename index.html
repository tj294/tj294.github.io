			<p><i>Haunted Exeter</i> is the South-West's <b>premier</b> ghost-hunting organisation. Started by Tom <i>"Spaghetti Arms"</i> Joshi-Cale and Christina <i>"Rat Hands"</i> Williams, who were soon joined by Will <i>"Big Dog"</i> Luscombe, it is <i>Haunted Exeter</i>'s mission to find and eliminate all ghosts, poltergeists and other apparations from the earthly plane - but no further north than Tiverton (we will travel to Taunton if there's a cricket match on).</p>
