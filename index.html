	<h1>Welcome to Haunted Exeter</h1>
	<h2>The home of Spooks and Scares</h2>

	<p><i>Haunted Exeter</i> is the South-West's <b>Premier</b> ghost-hunting organisation. Started by Tom "Spaghetti Arms" Joshi-Cale and Christina "Rat Hands" Williams, it is <i>Haunted Exeter</i>'s mission to find and eliminate all ghosts, poltergeists and other apparations from the earthly plane - but no further north than Tiverton (we can travel to Taunton if there's a cricket match on).</p>
